[![Demo Object Detection](https://evergreenllc2020.github.io/img/yolooiosgif.gif)](https://youtu.be/6z2N35cOTmc)



Yolo model need to be downloaded and added to the project from apple core ml models website and imported into project
https://ml-assets.apple.com/coreml/models/Image/ObjectDetection/YOLOv3/YOLOv3.mlmodel
I could not upload it to git because of its huge size
